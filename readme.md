# Rationale

Throughout this assignment, positives and negatives arised from this.

The positives were able to create seamless nagivation throughout the project, jumping from one page to the next with ease was something done well in this assignment. Another was the response of the website to both desktop and mobile viewing, it flowed well together and was able to react okay.

The one negative that came off this was how the carrousel images looked in the end, my vision was to have the centre image be slightly bigger and sit on top of the other two, however that would've taken longer and more time than I had unfortunatly. Another is the inclusion of internal navigation, if I had more time, I could've added internal navigation and made it easier to navigate to certain sections.

[Prototype] (https://www.figma.com/design/hBws1flUJzyw01jrEbT04S/High-Fidelity-Prototypes?node-id=3-3&t=sMV2YRx6WM1afDwp-0)

Reviewing the high-fidelity prototype, you can clearly see how different the website looks with the layout, positioning and so on, certain things such as the text on the Key Works I had to keep it basic that way it would be responsive with phone devices, if I didn't it would take longer to code each section indivisually to make it viewable when viewing it on phone.

The one resource that helped me a lot was ChatGPT, it helped me when I was stuck on sections like the carrousel, when I had my HTML code, I would ask it why certain things weren't working, it would give me the explanation and allowed me to learn, AI help was mainly for the the carrousels in order to get them to scroll along, the header section, allowing me to create a drop down menu that navigates properly and finally how to make my design responsive when viewed on phone. The usage off it allowed me to understand what I was doing and with the knowledge I have, I can apply that in future designs. W3Schools was another, while it may seem basic at first, sometimes even basic code can be forgoton but W3Schools contains the essentials for both HTML5 and CSS as it allows the user to navigate and find specific queries or problems using it, it helped me when I had issues such as making my background color fill the whole page, I was unsure why it wasn't working but using W3Schools helped me resolve it.
